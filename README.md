# Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python - Solutions

This repository contains my personal lab exercises and solutions to the applied/code exercises from the textbook "Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python" (ISLP).

## About ISLP

"Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python" is a renowned textbook in the field of statistical learning and data science. It provides an accessible overview of key concepts and techniques necessary for understanding and working with statistical learning methods.

## Repository Structure

Each chapter from the textbook corresponds to a separate directory in this repository. Currently, solutions up to Chapter 6 are available. The structure is as follows:

- Chapter 2: Statistical Learning
- Chapter 3: Linear Regression
- ...
- Chapter 7: Moving Beyond Linearity

Inside each chapter's folder, you will find Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) that contain the labs and my solutions (exercises).

## Usage

The notebooks can be viewed directly on GitHub, or you can clone this repository to run and experiment with the code on your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/laineridgway/ISLP.git
```

Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed to run the .ipynb files. You can install it via Anaconda or directly with pip:
